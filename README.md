🤖 GenAI AI Assistant (Groq API)

A simple AI Assistant built while learning Generative AI, using the Groq API for fast and efficient LLM inference.
This project focuses on understanding how to connect to an LLM, send prompts, and get intelligent responses.

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a basic AI assistant that:

Takes user input (prompt)

Sends it to the Groq API

Receives and displays AI-generated responses

The goal is learning GenAI fundamentals, not building a production-ready system.
